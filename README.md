##Election Coverage 

This repository hosts code for exploring the 2016 presidential election coverage from three major news outlets, *The Guardian* (UK), *The New York Times*, and *The Wall Street Journal*. The coverage included in the analysis is from January through August of 2015. The objectives are to: 

1. Determine if the source can be predicted given the content with a series of classification models; 
2. Explore differences in the content across sources through topic modelling.
